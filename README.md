# Flow_tracking
Two matlab codes developed based on Speckle tracking and Optical Flow to track flow in microchannel videos and estimate flow velocity value and magnitude. The code will also compute thrombosis porosity and the time taken by the plug to form based on the video analysis (future work --> to be added).
